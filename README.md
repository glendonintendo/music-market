## Description
The pandemic was, and still is, a huge hit for music and local business. This hasnâ€™t stopped the musicians and music enthusiasts from finding ways to scratch that music itch, but it has limited their options for connecting with other local musicians and crafters of music products.

Music Market is a digital marketplace that connects local vendors of artisanal music products to musicians and music enthusiasts. Vendors are able to sell their goods while still being COVID safe, while musicians will be able to get high-quality instruments at competitive prices. By being able to browse and filter to their liking, musicians will have no problem finding the supplies they need to hit the ground running as venues start to open back up.
